# I got inspired by a Twitter #100DaysofCode post (https://twitter.com/ChiragPallan/status/1509139317331214336/photo/1)
# I am learning about ' re.findall ' because I kind of understood the code until that part. SO I GOOGLED IT.
# Here's what I'm reading now: (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-regex-re-search-vs-re-findall/)
# BECAUSE OF THIS, I remember how to leave comments. My code *should* be commentated herein.
