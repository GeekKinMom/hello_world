# I got inspired by a Twitter #100DaysofCode post (https://twitter.com/ChiragPallan/status/1509139317331214336/photo/1)
# I am learning about ' re.findall ' because I kind of understood the code until that part. SO I GOOGLED IT.
# Here's what I'm reading now: (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-regex-re-search-vs-re-findall/)
# BECAUSE OF THIS, I remember how to leave comments. My code *should* be commentated herein. 

# Learning About re.search() and re.findall()
#  \   Used to drop the special meaning of character
#    following it (discussed below)
#  []  Represent a character class
#  ^   Matches the beginning
#  $   Matches the end
#  .   Matches any character except newline
#  ?   Matches zero or one occurrence.
#  |   Means OR (Matches with any of the characters
#      separated by it.
#  *   Any number of occurrences (including 0 occurrences)
#  +   One or more occurrences
#  {}  Indicate number of occurrences of a preceding RE 
#      to match.
#  ()  Enclose a group of REs

# " Module Regular Expressions (RE) specifies a set of strings (pattern) that matches it. " I'll come back to this topic. The above table is useful :)

# I'm heading back to the topic: BOOLEAN on Sololearn. I'll be back to show code bits. 

# Over Under  If Else
y = 19
if y >= 18:
      print("You are an adult.")
else:
      print("You are a minor.")
      
grade = 62
if (grade>=70):
  print("You've Passed!")
else:
  print("You've Failed!")
  
# If Else and elif
  
  num = 3
if num == 1:
  print("One")
else: 
  if num == 2:
    print("Two")
  else: 
    if num == 3: 
      print("Three")
    else: 
      print("Something else")
      
num = 3
if num == 1:
  print("One")
elif num == 2:
  print("Two")
elif num == 3:

# Practice

age = int(input())
if age >= 18:
      print("Allowed")
else:
      print("Sorry")


# Operators and Boolean Doubles

print(1 == 1 and 2 == 2)

print(1 == 1 and 2 == 3)

print(1 != 1 and 2 == 2)

print(2 < 1 and 3 > 6)
