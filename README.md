# I am GeekKinMom, a geek, a lover of gaming and geekery, and I'm starting my journey with Python and Scratch.

<p> I love Sci-Fi, board games, role-playing games, and sandbox games. My current favorite game is Disgaea 6, which allows you to program the AI for your characters to play while you're AFK! This reintroduced my deep-seated need to learn coding languages. And the most important thing in learning to code is learning how to commit on GitHub. So, let's learn. </p>

# Collaborations Will Be Welcome Summer 2022

<p> I am giving myself 3 months to learn before I want to commit to any social code, but I am SO excited to join the programming community. I'll be quietly lurki--- I mean, learning... in the background. </p>
